\section{UROP Abstract}

This atlas was compiled using a medium resolution infrared spectrograph, Spex, at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.  Spex was upgraded in August 2014, during data collection.  While maintaining a resolution of R ≡ λ/Δλ ∼ 2000, the wavelength range was extended from 0.80-2.4~$\mu$m to the current range of 0.70-2.55~$\mu$m.  Spectroscopic analysis at infrared wavelengths will allow for more accurate classification of young stars.  Members of Upper Scorpius (upperSco), a star-forming region, were chosen due to having well-established ages.  Inconsistencies between infrared and optical spectral classifications will show the need for a more comprehensive young star library.
