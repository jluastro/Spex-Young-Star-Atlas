\section{UROP Abstract}

This new spectral atlas of 51 young stars was compiled using a medium-resolution infrared spectrograph, Spex, at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.  Spex was upgraded in August 2014, during data collection.  While maintaining a resolution of R ≡ λ/Δλ ∼ 2000, the wavelength range was extended from 0.80-2.4~$\mu$m to the current range of 0.70-2.55~$\mu$m.  All atlas stars were selected from the star-forming region Upper Scorpius, which has a well-established age of $\~11~Myr$. Clear variations between old and young stars are observed, which will help constrain models of stellar evolution and atmospheres, at infrared wavelengths. Our new spectral atlas will allow for more accurate classification of young stars.  Inconsistencies between infrared and optical spectral classifications will show the need for a more comprehensive young star library.
