\section{Data and Analysis}

%Comparison of the data taken on each A0V standard to that of a well known A0V, Vega, allowed for the determination of atmospheric residuals.  %Spextool made this data reduction possible.  
%For reduction purposes, the Spex pipeline was used\footnote{\url{http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/~spex/SpeX_manual_06mar15.pdf}}.  The difference between an observed A0V and the model for Vega can be attributed to atmospheric conditions existing at the time of observation.
