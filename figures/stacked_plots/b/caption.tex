{\bf Sequence from 0.7–2.55 $\mu$m. From bottom to top, these spectra are of HD 143567 (B9V), HIP 79599 (B9V), HIP 76633 (B9V), HD 144661 (B8V), HIP 78207 (B8V), HIP 79031 (B8V), HIP 77909 (B8V), HIP 70753 (B8V), HD 138485 (B3V), HIP 78933 (B1V).
%The spectra have been normalized to unity at 1.10 μm and offset by constants (dotted lines).
All spectra shown have been normalized to unity at 1.10$\mu$m, then separated by various constants.  Strong telluric absorption (transmission <20\%) is shown by dark gray.  Moderate telluric absorption (transmission <80\%) is shown in light gray regions.\label{fig:stack-plot-b}}
