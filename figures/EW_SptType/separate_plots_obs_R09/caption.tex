{\bf Each spectral feature listed in Table~\ref{tab:features} has its own plot, where EWs are shown as a function of spectral type.  Young stars are shown in black while R09 objects are in color.  R09 stars were separated into three classes: dwarfs, giants, supergiants.\label{fig:EW-separate-obs-R09}}
