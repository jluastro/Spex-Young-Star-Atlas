We present a new spectral atlas of 46 young stars, compiled using a medium-resolution 
infrared spectrograph, SpeX, at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.  
%SpeX was upgraded in August 2014, during data collection.  While maintaining a resolution of R ≡ λ/Δλ ∼ 2000, the wavelength range was extended from 0.80-2.4~$\mu$m to the current range of 0.70-2.55~$\mu$m.  
SpeX maintains a resolution of $R \equiv \lambda/\Delta\lambda \sim 2000$, with a wavelength 
range of 0.70--2.55~$\mu$m. All atlas stars were selected from the star--forming region 
Upper Scorpius, which has a well-established age of $\sim$11~Myr. Clear variations between 
old and young stars are observed, which will help constrain models of stellar evolution and 
atmospheres, at infrared wavelengths. Our new spectral atlas will allow for more accurate 
classification of young stars.  Inconsistencies between infrared and optical spectral 
classifications will show the need for a more comprehensive young star library.
