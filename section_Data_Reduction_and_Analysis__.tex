\section{Data Reduction and Analysis}

All of the objects discussed in this paper were observed with the NASA Infra-Red Telescope Facility (IRTF) and the SpeX instrument \cite{Rayner_1998} in the short-wavelength cross-dispersed mode (SXD), with a resolution of 2000.  During observations, we collected two distinct types of data.  One set before Spex was updated and another after.  The most recent upgrade to Spex occurred in August 2014.  This upgrade increased the observable wavelength.  See Table \ref{tab:maintab} for comparison.
