[NEED NAME OF PERSON WHO COMPLETED ACCRETION DISK SURVEY]
This database was built to better classify young stars (less than ~10Myr old).  For this reason it is essential that it includes stars of approximately the same age.  One of the top places to look for stars that formed at approximately the same time is in star forming region, solidifying the choice of observing upperSco stars.  Various parameters had to be met by each star before it was chosen for observation.  In order to build a comprehensive library stars that encompassed a wide range of spectral classes needed to be included, from class M to O.  Next, stars that were classified as having binary companions \cite{binary_guy} were eliminated.  Finally, any star that had been determined to have an accretion disk \cite{disk_guy} was also removed from the target list.  Restricting the selection of target objects based on such criteria ensures each observed spectrum is as isolated and representative as possible.
